set hidelevel [NUM]

Hide this many stack frames from the bottom (or least-recent) frame.

Often the bottom-most frames are setup frames that one doesn't think
of as being part of one's program but are part of the overhead loading
or debugging the program. As such generally they are unintersting in
a backtrace command and one wants these omitted.

If NUM is 0, no stack frames are hidden. If NUM is < 0 or omitted,
then use value the program sets automatically. If the value is larger
than the current number of entries in the stack, i.e. the stack shown
would be otherwise be, empty then we show all entries, or take NUM to
be 0.

Examples:
   set hidelevel     # Use the default value and hide 'uninteresting' ones
   set hidelevel 0   # Show all stack entries, even from loading the program
                     # or initial stack entries the debugger created to 
                     # debug the program.
   set hidelevel 1   # Hide only the bottom-most or least-recent stack frame.
