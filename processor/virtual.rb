# The class serves as the parent for Trepan::CmdProcessor which is 
# quite large and spans over several files. By declaring initialize
# below, we have a consistent initialize routine and many of the
# others don't need to define initialize.

# Also, simple versions of the I/O routines make it possible
# to do testing without having to bring in the whole "Interface"
# and I/O routines that trepanning (and "main.rb") use.

# Note that via this file we can change 'module Trepan' to 'class
# Trepan' and this takes effect on all of the places which 
# subclass this. They use class 
#  Trepan::CmdProcessor < Trepan::VirtualCmdProcessor
# rather than breaking this down into to parts as below.
