This code builds off of code from the Rubinius reference debugger. At
the time it was created, Brian Ford and Evan Phoenix were the primary
forces behind that. See the AUTHORS file in the Rubinius distribution
for a complete list of Rubinius authors.

I am very grateful to Evan for so graceously and willing making
numerous little changes that I tink not only improve the debugging
experience, but increase location reporting and live introspection.

Ideas and in some cases command structure or exact text from help,
command name, command structure, and errors messages have come from
gdb and ruby-debug. The creative force and author of ruby-debug is
Kent Sibilev.  Other ideas from other debuggers are used here; in
particular, the debugger that comes distributed with Python, pdb.
