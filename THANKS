This code builds off of code from the Rubinius reference debugger. At
the time it was created, Brian Ford and Evan Phoenix were the primary
forces behind that. See the AUTHORS file in the Rubinius distribution
for a complete list of Rubinius contributors.

Ideas and in some cases command structure or exact text from help,
command, or errors messages have come from gdb and
ruby-debug. ruby-debug is the brain-child of Kent Sibilev.  Other
ideas from other debuggers are used here, inparticular the debugger
that comes distributed with Python, pdb.
