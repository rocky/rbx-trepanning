This code builds off of code from the Rubinius reference debugger. At
the time it was created, Brian Ford and Evan Phoenix were the primary
forces behind that. See the AUTHORS file in the Rubinius distribution
for a complete list of Rubinius authors.

Ideas and in some cases command structure or exact text from help,
command name, command structure, and errors messages have come from
gdb and ruby-debug. ruby-debug is the brain-child of Kent Sibilev.
Other ideas from other debuggers are used here; in particular, the
debugger that comes distributed with Python, pdb.
