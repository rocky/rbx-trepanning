Trepanning source-level debugger 

Invoking in Code
----------------

The Rubinius debugger can be invoked from code by embedding a call to start
the debugger

Consider the following code in app.rb

    class Toast
      attr_accessor :setting
      def initialize
        require 'rubygems'
        require 'trepanning'
        Trepan.start ## See Note 1 below.
        @setting = :brown
        @kind    = :rye
      end
    end

    p Toast.new.setting

Running the code in Rubinius would produce the following:

    $ rbx app.rb

    | Breakpoint: Toast#initialize at tmp/toast.rb:5
    | 5:     Trepan.start ## See Note 1 below.
    (trepanx): help

    Classes of commands:
    breakpoints   -- Making the program stop at certain points
    data          -- Examining data
    files         -- Specifying and examining files
    running       -- Running the program
    stack         -- Examining the call stack
    status        -- Status inquiries
    support       -- Support facilities

    Type "help" followed by a class name for a list of commands in that class.
    Type "help *" for the list of all commands.
    Type "help REGEXP" for the list of commands matching /^#{REGEXP}/
    Type "help CLASS *" for the list of all commands in class CLASS.
    Type "help" followed by command name for full documentation.

    (trepanx): help *
    All command names:
      alias        delete         exit     kill     restart    step   
      backtrace    disassemble    frame    next     set        tbreak 
      break        down           help     nexti    show       unalias
      continue     eval           info     ps       source     up     
    (trepanx):  bt
    Backtrace:

    :light_brown   # output from running program

Help for the debugger commands is available by typing `help` when in the
debugger. 

** Note 1.
Or if you haven't mucked with ARGV, Dir.pwd, and $0 use:
Trepan.start(:set_restart => true).  This tells the debugger to
capture this information so you can easily restart your program if you
need to.

** Note 2. 
If you run "set autoeval on" (actually this is on by default), then
unrecognized commands are automatically evaluated. So the "eval" is
not needed. However if this confuses you "set autoeval off".  Another
way to explicitly evaluate commands is to start the line with !.

** Note 3.

To quit execution, you can use exit which prompts for confimation or
q! which won't prompt. You can supply an exit code to return to the
OS. A related command is "kill" which sends a signal to the process,
the default when none is supplied being "TERM". Finally there's
"restart" which you would use if you had started with :set_restart =>
true.
