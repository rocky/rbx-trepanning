	catching !,? or = at the end.

2010-11-15  rvm <rocky@gnu.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/location.rb: We pick up the eval_string

	Rubinuis::OS_ARGV and Rubinius::OS_STARTUP_DIR. Thanks, Evan!

2010-11-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/default.rb, app/run.rb, lib/trepanning.rb: Generalize
	standalone hack so and include -Xdebug.

2010-11-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/backtrace.rb: Wasn't starting from top if we had

	hacky means, but it's the best I can find for now.  Added a null
	output routine and the -q (silence) option on the source command.

2010-11-08  rvm <rocky@gnu.org>
