A debugger for Rubinius 1.1

Right now this debugger is beta code. To install you'll need to install
columnize (from gemcutter.org) and rbx-linecache, the rubinius branch 

bc. 
    $ gem install columnize
    $ gem install rbx-require-relative
    ...
    $ svn co http://rocky-hacks.rubyforge.org/svn/linecache/branches/rubinius rbx-linecache
    $ cd rbx-lineache
    $ rake install # add "sudo" if needed

There is a "google group mailing list:http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-debugger" for Ruby debuggers.

If rbx-trepanning is installed, here is the preferred way to run:

bc.  require 'trepanning' 
 Trepan.debug # Don't stop here...
 work # but stop here.

or if you haven't mucked around with $0 and ARGV, you might try:

bc.  Trepan.debug(:set_restart=>true)

which informs the debugger on how to restart the program (via the restart command) using the values of ARGV and $0 at the time Trepan.debug was called.

There is extensive on-line help. Run "help" inside the debugger.
