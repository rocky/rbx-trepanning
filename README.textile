A debugger for Rubinius 1.2.x

bc.  [sudo] gem install rbx-trepanning

should get you going.

There is a "google group mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-debugger for Ruby debuggers.

To run initially: 

bc. 
   $ trepanx my-ruby-program.rb

Or to call from inside your code: 

bc.   require 'trepanning' 
   debugger # Don't stop here...
    work # but stop here.

If you want an immediate stop:

bc.  debugger(:immediate=>true)

Finally, if you put in your .trepanx

bc.   Rubinius::Loader.debugger = proc { 
    require 'trepanning'; 
    Trepan.start(:skip_loader => :Xdebug) 


Then you can use the -Xdebug option the Ruby, e.g.

bc. rbx -Xdebug my-ruby-program.rb

There is extensive on-line help. Run "help" inside the debugger.
